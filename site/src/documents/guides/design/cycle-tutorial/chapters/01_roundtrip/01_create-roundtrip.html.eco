      At the left box "My Roundtrips", hit "Create" to create a new Roundtrip. Pick a name and hit "OK". In our
      example, we assume that a new Roundtrip named "invoice" has been created.
    </p>

      We will now add a process model from our BPMN modeler to the roundtrip, and create the process model we want
      to execute out of it. Currently, the roundtrip works best with the Signavio Process Editor, so this is why we
      describe it in the next section. Further below you can find a general description for other BPMN tools.
