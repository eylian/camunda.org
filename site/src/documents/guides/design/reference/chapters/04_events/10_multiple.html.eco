				We can use the multiple event to summarize several events with a single symbol. The diagram below applies the multiple event to our pizza scenario.
				In the example, we try a new pizza after having seen it on TV or after a friend recommended it. After eating it, we will rate the pizza on Pizzatest.de and in turn inform our friend if
				we also recommend this pizza.

					You have to decide if multiple events serve your purposes. We concede their benefit in rough functional process descriptions, but they cease to be as useful in the more advanced
					technical-implementation phase. You can't afford to leave relevant details hiding in the descriptive text. We don't find the multiple event to be intuitive, nor is it helpful on a functional level.
					It may make your diagrams larger to model all events separately, but the resulting diagrams will be both more comprehensive and more comprehensible.
					The bottom line is that we have never used this symbol in practice, nor have we seen anybody else doing so.

						The model in here describes the same process, but the events are fully modeled:
