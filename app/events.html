				<h1>Basic Concepts</h1>
			</div>
			<p>
				Tasks and gateways are two of three flow elements we've come to know so far: Things (tasks) have to be done under certain circumstances (gateways). What flow element is still missing? 
				The things (events) that are supposed to happen. Events are no less important for BPMN process models than tasks or gateways. We should start with some basic principles for applying them. 
				We already saw Start events, intermediate events, and end events. Those three event types are also catching and/or throwing events:
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Catching events</b> are events with a defined trigger. We consider that they take place once the trigger has activated or fired. As an intellectual construct, that is relatively intricate, 
				so we simplify by calling them catching events. The point is that these events influence the course of the process and therefore must be modeled. Catching events may result in:
				<ul>
					<li>The process starting</li>
					<li>The process or a process path continuing</li>
					<li>The task currently processed or the sub-process being canceled</li>
					<li>Another process path being used while a task or a sub-process executes</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Throwing events</b> are assumed by BPMN to trigger themselves instead of reacting to a trigger. You could say that they are active compared to passive catching events. 
				We call them throwing events for short, because the process triggers them. Throwing events can be:
				<ul>
					<li>Triggered during the process</li>
					<li>Triggered at the end of the process</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			
			<p>
			We can also model attached intermediate events with BPMN. These do not explicitly require waiting, but they do interrupt our activities, both tasks and sub-processes. 
			Such intermediate events are attached because we position them at the boundary of the activity we want to interrupt. 
			</p>

			<div id="boundary" style="position:relative" data-bpmn-src="tutorial/boundary">
				<div class="tutPop" id="sid-CF6B2EA1-1671-4A0C-BBFC-819B8C7C0A37" rel="popover" title="Boundary Event" data-content="
					If this event occurs while task 1 is active, task 1 will be canceled and task 3 completed instead.
				">
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<p>
				A token running through the process would behave this way: 
				<ul>
					<li>The token moves to task 1, which starts accordingly.</li>
					<li>If event 1 occurs while task 1 is being processed, task 1 is immediately canceled, and the token moves through the exception flow to task 3.</li>
					<li>On the other hand, if event 1 does not occur, task 1 will be processed, and the token moves through the regular sequence flow to task 2.</li>
					<li>If event 1 occurs only after task 1 completes, it will be ignored.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				Through BPMN version 1.2, with the exception of compensation events, attached intermediate events inevitably resulted in canceled activities. BPMN 2.0 defines a new symbol: 
				the non-interrupting intermediate event. It sounds awkward, but it is useful:

					If this event occurs while task 1 is active, task 1 will still get completed and task 3 will also get completed.
				">
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>
				The token moves through the process as follows:
				<ul>
					<li>The token moves to task 1, which starts accordingly.</li>
					<li>If event 1 occurs while task 1 is being processed, the token is cloned. Task 1 continues to be processed while the second token moves to task 3, which is now also processed. 
					This procedure may even take place repeatedly, that is, the event can occur many times. Each occurrence results in another cloned token.</li>
					<li>If event 1 does <b>not</b> occur, task 1 will be completed, and the token moves through the regular sequence flow to task 2.</li>
					<li>If event 1 occurs only after task 1 completes, it ceases to matter.</li>
				</ul>
				In the following sections, we introduce the event types to be used when working with BPMN. We also explain how you can react to different events using the event-based gateway.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section id="messageSect">
			<div class="page-header" >
				<h1>Message Events</h1>
			</div>
			<p>
				Sooner or later, most processes require communication, which can be represented in BPMN by means of the message event.
				You'll recognize it as the small envelope. The meaning of "message" in BPMN is not restricted to letters, e-mails, or calls. Any action that refers to a specific addressee 
				and represents or contains information for the addressee is a message. 
			</p>
				<div class="label label-warning">Hover over orange symbols for explanation</div>

						In this example, the pizza ordering issue has been fully modeled: We choose a pizza, and we order it. We then wait for the pizza to be delivered. After delivery, we eat.

								<b>Heads up!</b> We are not always happy with the throwing intermediate event. Implying a "send message" task without modeling it explicitly can easily confuse 
								inexperienced consumers of our models. We choose not to use throwing intermediate events for messages and instead use a task. 
								There are also special BPMN task types for sending and receiving messages.
							</p>
				  </div>
				</div>
			  </div>
			 </p>
			<p>
				In the example below, we show a message leading to cancellation. In this scenario, we administer a web application. When a user notifies us that the website does not work, we 
				immediately search for the error. But maybe the user is mistaken, and the website is fine. Maybe the user's Internet connection is defective. If the user tells us about the false alarm,
				we cancel the search and swear at the user for wasting our time. If the error is actually found, however, we eliminate it and simultaneously figure out who caused the error. If the user caused 
				the error, we can swear at the user for a different reason. If the user is not at fault, however, we thank him or her graciously for letting us know about the problem.

			<div class="page-header" >
				<h1>Timer Events</h1>
			</div>
			<p>
				The timer event is often used when working with BPMN because it is so flexible to apply. A clock icon represents the timer event. The diagram below shows a few examples of applications:
			</p>
			<div id="timer_examples" style="position:relative" data-bpmn-src="tutorial/timer_examples">
			</div>	
			<p>
				Time moves on no matter what we or our processes do, so timer events can exist only as catching starts or intermediate events.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can model countdown times with an attached timer event. They are used this way frequently. You can specify upper time limits - the maximum time allowed for a processing task - for instance:

					The task this event is attached to may take a maximum of 30 minutes. If the time expires before the task completes, the 'choose pizza' task is canceled, and we cook pasta instead. In either case, we eat the meal at the end. 
				">
				</div>
			</div>	
			<p>Non-interrupting timer events became possible with BPMN 2.0:</p>

				</div>
			</div>
		</section>
		<section id="errorSect">
			<div class="page-header" >
				<h1>Error Events</h1>
			</div>
			<p>
				Do your processes run completely error-free? If not, you can identify potential errors in your models as a step toward eliminating them, or as part of modeling escalation processes. 
				In BPMN, error events are represented by a flash symbol.
			</p>
			<p>
				The BPMN specification does not specify what an error may be. As the modeler, you have to decide that.
			</p>
			<p>
				An error is a serious event in BPMN, so if catching, it can be modeled only as an attached intermediate event. This means that an error during task execution must be handled in a specific way: 
				As a throwing event, it can be modeled only at the end of a process path so that the participant knows the process has failed. The parent process should likewise recognize the failure. (We explain the interaction between parent  and sub-processes here TODO. You'll also find an example of applying an error event there.) 
			</p>
		</section>
		<section id="conditionSect">
			<div class="page-header" >
				<h1>Conditional Events</h1>
			</div>
			<p>
				Sometimes we only want a process to start or to continue if a certain condition is true. Anything can be a condition, and conditions are independent of processes, 
				which is why the condition (like the timer event) can only exist as a catching event. A process cannot therefore conditional event trigger a conditional event. 
			</p>
			<p>
				We can enhance our pizza process with conditions. If we want to have frozen pizza, the process starts as shown in the diagram below. We take the pizza from the freezer and turn on the oven. 
				But only after the temperature in the oven reaches 180 C do we put the pizza in, and only after it is done do we take it out to eat.  
			</p>
			<div id="conditional" style="position:relative" data-bpmn-src="tutorial/conditional">
			</div>
		</section>
		<section id="signalSect">
			<div class="page-header" >
				<h1>Signal Events</h1>
			</div>			
			<p>
				Signals are similar to messages, which is why you can model them in BPMN as events just as you can with messages. 
				The symbol for a signal is a triangle. The essential difference between a signal and a message is that that latter is always addressed to a specific recipient. 
				(An e-mail contains the e-mail address of the recipient, a call starts with dialing the telephone number, and so on.) 
				In contrast, a signal is more like a newspaper advertisement or a television commercial. It is relatively undirected. Anyone who receives the signal and wants to react may do so.  
			</p>
			<div id="signal" style="position:relative" data-bpmn-src="tutorial/signal">
			</div>			
			<p>
				We saw a new frozen pizza on TV, and we are keen to try it. The diagram above illustrates this new situation. We buy the pizza, but we keep it in the freezer until we're really hungry for pizza. 
				That's a conditional event. After trying the new pizza, we go to Pizzatest.de to rate the new product. That's a signal. It is a signal for the general public too. 
				(Pizzatest.de actually exists, by the way, which proves again that you can find simply <b>everything</b> on the Internet!) 			
			</p>
		</section>
		<section id="terminationSect">
			<div class="page-header" >
				<h1>Termination Events</h1>
			</div>				
			<p>
				Let's look at the abstract example below. We already discussed (simple) Key Performance Indicator (KPI) analysis, and we therefore know that this process always takes 55 minutes. 
				After task 1, tasks 2 and 3 can be processed simultaneously. Processing task 2 takes more time than does processing task 3, which is why it determines the runtime of the process. 
				A token that runs through the process is cloned in the AND split. The first token stays in task 2 for 45 minutes; the second token stays in task 3 for 30 minutes. 
				The second token arrives at the none event first, where it is consumed. After 15 more minutes, the first token arrives at the upper none event, where it is consumed too. 
				Since no more tokens are available, the process instance finishes after 55 minutes. 
			</p>
			<div id="terminate_without" style="position:relative" data-bpmn-src="tutorial/terminate_without">
			</div>			
			<p>
				So far, so good, but what happens if we already know that, after having completed task 3, task 2 has become redundant? This is a frequent situation with parallel task executions related to content. 
				In such cases, we can apply the pattern shown in here: 
			</p>
			<div class="label label-warning">Hover over orange symbols for explanation</div>
			<div id="terminate" style="position:relative" data-bpmn-src="tutorial/terminate">
				<div class="tutPop" id="sid-A14E9B4C-CDAE-45C0-A878-082E588C6941" rel="popover" title="Terminate Event" data-content="
					We use the terminate event to make sure that ALL available tokens are consumed immediately. 
				That leads to the termination of the process instance, consequently, you can use the terminate event as an end event only.
				">
				</div>				
			</div>
		</section>
		<section id="linkSect">
			<div class="page-header" >
				<h1>Link Events</h1>
			</div>			
			<p>	
				The link event is a special case. It has no significance related to content, but it facilitates the diagram-creation process. 
				As shown below, you can draw two associated links as an alternative to a sequence flow. Here, "associated" means there is a throwing link event as the "exit point," 
				and a catching link event as the "entrance point," and the two events are marked as a pair - in our example by the designation "A." 
			</p>
			<div id="link" style="position:relative" data-bpmn-src="tutorial/link">
			</div>			
			<p>
				Link events can be very useful if:
				<ul>
					<li>You have to distribute a process diagram across several pages. Links orient the reader from one page to the next.</li>
					<li>You draw comprehensive process diagrams with many sequence flows. Links help avoid what otherwise might look like a "spaghetti" diagram.</li>
				</ul>
				Link events can be used as intermediate events only.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section id="compensationSect">
			<div class="page-header" >
				<h1>Compensation Events</h1>
			</div>			
			<p>
				We execute tasks in our processes that sometimes have to be canceled later under certain circumstances. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Typical examples are:
				<ul>
					<li>Booking a train or airline ticket</li>
					<li>Reserving a rental car</li>
					<li>Charging a credit card</li>
					<li>Commissioning a service provider</li>
				</ul>
				Below, we see this process: On Friday at 1 p.m. we agree with our partner either to go to the theater or to spend the evening with friends.
				In both cases, we have to do something binding, either to reserve the theater tickets or make the arrangements with our friends. 
				When evening arrives, perhaps we no longer feel like going out at all. We then have to cancel the arrangements we made with the theater or our friends before we can collapse in front of the TV in peace:
			</p>
			<div  style="width:100%; overflow:auto;">
				<div id="compensation_without" style="position:relative" data-bpmn-src="tutorial/compensation_without">
				</div>			
			</div>
			<p>
				We can represent the latter part of the model more compactly with a compensation event, as shown in here: 
			</p>
			<div class="label label-warning">Hover over orange symbols for explanation</div>
			<div id="compensation" style="position:relative" data-bpmn-src="tutorial/compensation">
				<div class="tutPop" id="sid-6CB628A9-C00C-44F4-A2B0-9B1749277A09" rel="popover" title="Compensation Event (throw)" data-content="
					If we don't feel like going out, we have to cancel all our arrangements; we don't have to check which ones to cancel. 							">
				</div>				
			</div>			
			<p>
				There are special rules for handling compensations:
				<ul>
					<li>Throwing compensations refer to their own processes, so the event is effective within the pool. This shows how this event type differs from a throwing message event.</li>
					<li>Other attached events can take effect only while the activities to which they are attached remain active. 
					In contrast, an attached compensation takes effect only if the process triggers a compensation <b>and</b> the activity to which the compensation is attached successfully completed.</li>
					<li>Attached compensation events connect to compensation tasks through associations, and <b>not</b> through sequence flows, which would otherwise be common usage. 
					BPMN thus emphasizes that compensations are beyond the regular process sequence; executing one is an exception.</li>
					<li>The obligatory compensation task is a special task type that we explain with other task types in TODO</li>
				</ul>

					This example may be too simple to illustrate how much work this construct can save you. If you think of the complex business processes that frequently require compensations, 
					however, you'll see how much leaner your models can be. You'll also be quick to spot the circumstances that demand compensations.  We use compensation events only 
					occasionally to describe complex processes.

			<div class="page-header" >
				<h1>Multiple Events</h1>

			<p>
				We can use the multiple event to summarize several events with a single symbol. The diagram below applies the multiple event to our pizza scenario. 
				In the example, we try a new pizza after having seen it on TV or after a friend recommended it. After eating it, we will rate the pizza on Pizzatest.de and in turn inform our friend if 
				we also recommend this pizza.

					You have to decide if multiple events serve your purposes. We concede their benefit in rough functional process descriptions, but they cease to be as useful in the more advanced

					It may make your diagrams larger to model all events separately, but the resulting diagrams will be both more comprehensive and more comprehensible.

			</div>			
			<p>
				The parallel event was added in BPMN 2.0 to supplement the multiple event. While a catching multiple event has XOR semantics - it occurs as soon as 
				<b>one</b> of its contained events occurs - the parallel event uses AND semantics. It doesn't occur until <b>all</b> of its contained events occur. Because the throwing multiple event 
				already implies AND semantics, the specification defines parallel events as catching events only.
