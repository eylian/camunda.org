      <p>A Receive Task is a simple task that waits for the arrival of a certain message. Currently, we have only implemented Java semantics for this task. When process execution arrives at a Receive Task, the process state is committed to the persistence store. This means that the process will stay in this wait state, until a specific message is received by the engine, which triggers the continuation of the process past the Receive Task. </p>

      <div id="service-task" style="position:relative" data-bpmn-src="implement/service-task" />


      <p>
  <div class="app-source" app-source-no-tabs="receive1" ></div>
  <script type="text/xml" id="receive1">
<receiveTask id="waitState" name="wait" />    
  </script>

To continue a process instance that is currently waiting at such a Receive Task, the runtimeService.signal(executionId) must be called using the id of the execution that arrived in the Receive Task. The following code snippet shows how this works in practice:

  <div class="app-source" app-source-no-tabs="xxxx" ></div>
  <script type="text/xml" id="xxxx">
ProcessInstance pi = runtimeService.startProcessInstanceByKey("receiveTask");
Execution execution = runtimeService.createExecutionQuery()
  .processInstanceId(pi.getId())
  .activityId("waitState")
  .singleResult();
assertNotNull(execution);
    
runtimeService.signal(execution.getId());   
  </script>
</p>
