        A Business Rule task is used to synchronously execute one or more rules. 
      </p>

      <div id="service-task" style="position:relative" data-bpmn-src="implement/business-rule-task" />
      <p>
        You might use the rule engine of your choice, on the open source side we 
        made good experiences with JBoss Drools. Therefor You have to plug in your implementation of the rule task exactly like in a Service Task.
        So the difference is only that it has a different icon in the BPMN process model - but this can make already a huge difference for acceptance 
        of the process model.
