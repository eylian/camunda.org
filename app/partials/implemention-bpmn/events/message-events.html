Message events are events which reference a named message. A message has a name and a payload. Unlike a signal, a message event is always directed at a single receiver.

A message event definition is declared using the messageEventDefinition element. The attribute messaageRef references a message element declared as a child element of the definitions root element. The following is an excerpt of a process where two message events is declared and referenced by a start event and an intermediate catching message event.

<h2>Throwing Message Events</h2>
As an embeddable process engine, activiti is not concerned with actually receiving a message. This would be environment dependenent and entail platform-specific activities like connecting to a JMS (Java Messaging Service) Queue/Topic or processing a Webservice or REST request. The reception of messages is therefore something you have to implement as part of the application or infrastructure into which the process engine is embedded.

After you have received a messge inside your application, you must decide what to do with it. If the message should trigger the start of a new process instance, choose between the following methods offered by the runtime service:

<div class="app-source" app-source-no-tabs="message-event2" ></div>
<script type="text/xml" id="message-event2"> 
ProcessInstance startProcessInstanceByMessage(String messageName);
ProcessInstance startProcessInstanceByMessage(String messageName, Map<String, Object> processVariables);
ProcessInstance startProcessInstanceByMessage(String messageName, String businessKey, Map<String, Object> processVariables);            
</script>

These methods allow starting a process instance using the referenced message.

If the message needs to be received by an existing process instance, you first have to correlate the message to a specific process instance (see next section) and then trigger the continuation of the wating execution. The runtime service offers the following methods for triggering an execution based on a message event subscription:

<div class="app-source" app-source-no-tabs="message-event3" ></div>
<script type="text/xml" id="message-event3"> 
void messageEventReceived(String messageName, String executionId);
void messageEventReceived(String messageName, String executionId, HashMap<String, Object> processVariables);    
</script>

<h2>Querying for Message Event subscriptions</h2>
Activiti supports message start events and intermediate message events.

    In the case of a message start event, the message event subscription is associated with a particular process definition. Such message subscriptions can be queried using a ProcessDefinitionQuery:

<div class="app-source" app-source-no-tabs="message-event4" ></div>
<script type="text/xml" id="message-event4"> 
ProcessDefinition processDefinition = repositoryService.createProcessDefinitionQuery()
        .messageEventSubscription("newCallCenterBooking")
        .singleResult();
</script>                    

    Since there can only be one process definition for a specific message subscription, the query always returns zero or one results. If a process definition is updated, only the newest version of the process definition has a subscription to the message event.
</p>
<p>
    In the case of an intermediate catch message event, the message event subscription is associated with a particular execution. Such message event subscriptions can be queried using a ExecutionQuery:

<div class="app-source" app-source-no-tabs="message-event5" ></div>
<script type="text/xml" id="message-event5"> 
    Execution execution = runtimeService.createExecutionQuery()
          .messageEventSubscriptionName("paymentReceived")
          .processVariableValueEquals("orderId", message.getOrderId())
          .singleResult();
</script>

    Such queries are called correlation queries and usually require knowledge about the processes (in this case that there will be at most one process instance for a given orderId). 

</p>

<h1>Message Start Event</h1>

<p>
A message start event can be used to start a process instance using a named message. This effectively allows us to select the right start event from a set of alternative start events using the message name.
</p>
<p>
When deploying a process definition with one or more message start events, the following considerations apply:
<ul>
    <li>The name of the message start event must be unique across a given process definition. A process definition must not have multiple message start events with the same name. Activiti throws an exception upon deployment of a process definition such that two or more message start events reference the same message of if two or more message start events reference messages with the same message name.</li>

    <li>The name of the message start event must be unique across all deployed process definitions. Activiti throws an exception upon deployment of a process definition such that one or more message start events reference a message with the same name as a message start event already deployed by a different process definition.</li>

    <li>Process versioning: Upon deployment of a new version of a process definition, the message subscriptions of the previous version are cancelled. This is also true for message events that are not present in the new version.</li>
</ul>

When starting a process instance, a message start event can be triggered using the following methods on the RuntimeService:

<div class="app-source" app-source-no-tabs="message-event6" ></div>
<script type="text/xml" id="message-event6"> 
ProcessInstance startProcessInstanceByMessage(String messageName);
ProcessInstance startProcessInstanceByMessage(String messageName, Map<String, Object> processVariables);
ProcessInstance startProcessInstanceByMessage(String messageName, String businessKey, Map<String, Object< processVariables); 
</script>                                

The messageName is the name given in the name attribute of the message element referenced by the messageRef attribute of the messageEventDefinition. The following considerations apply when starting a process instance:
<ul>
    <li>Message start events are only supported on top-level processes. Message start events are not supported on embedded sub processes.</li>

    <li>If a process definition has multiple message start events, runtimeService.startProcessInstanceByMessage(...) allows to select the appropriate start event.</li>

    <li>If a process definition has multiple message start events and a single none start event, runtimeService.startProcessInstanceByKey(...) and runtimeService.startProcessInstanceById(...) starts a process instance using the none start event.</li>

    <li>If a process definition has multiple message start events and no none start event, runtimeService.startProcessInstanceByKey(...) and runtimeService.startProcessInstanceById(...) throw an exception.</li>

    <li>If a process definition has a single message start event, runtimeService.startProcessInstanceByKey(...) and runtimeService.startProcessInstanceById(...) start a new process instance using the message start event.</li>

    <li>If a process is started from a call activity, message start event(s) are only supported if
    <ul>
        <li>in addition to the message start event(s), the process has a single none start event</li>

        <li>the process has a single message start event and no other start events.</li>
    </ul></li>
</ul>

 The XML representation of a message start event is the normal start event declaration with a messageEventDefinition child-element:

<div class="app-source" app-source-no-tabs="message-event6" ></div>
<script type="text/xml" id="message-event6"> 
<definitions id="definitions" 
  xmlns="http://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/20100524/MODEL"
  xmlns:activiti="http://activiti.org/bpmn"
  targetNamespace="Examples"
  xmlns:tns="Examples">
  
  <message id="newInvoice" name="newInvoiceMessage" />
  
  <process id="invoiceProcess">  
  
    <startEvent id="messageStart" >
        <messageEventDefinition messageRef="tns:newInvoice" />
    </startEvent>
    ...    
  </process>

</definitions>
</script>

A process can be started using one of two different messages, this is useful if the process needs alternative ways to react to different start events but eventually continues in a uniform way. 

<div id="event-message-start-alternative" style="position:relative" data-bpmn-src="implement/event-message-start-alternative" />

	</p>





  <h1>Message Intermediate Catching Event</h1>
  <p>
    When a token arrives at the message intermediate catching event it will wait there until a message with the proper name arrives. As already described the message must be handed into the engine via the appropriate API calls.

    The following example shows different message events in a process model:

    <div id="event-message" style="position:relative" data-bpmn-src="implement/event-message" />

<div class="app-source" app-source-no-tabs="message-event7" ></div>
<script type="text/xml" id="message-event7"> 
<intermediateCatchEvent id="message">
        <messageEventDefinition signalRef="newCustomerMessage" />
</intermediateCatchEvent>
</script>
 
   Instead of the message intermediate catching event you might want to think about a <a href="#/tasks/receive-task">Receive Task</a> instead which can serve similar purposes, but is able to be used in combination with boundary events. Together with the  message intermediate catching event you might want to use the <a href="#/gateways/event-based-gateway">Event-based Gateway</a>.
  </p>




  <h1>Message Boundary Event</h1>
	<p>
Boundary events are catching events that are attached to an activity. This means that while the activity is running, the message boundary event is listening for named message. When this is caught, two things might happen depending on the configuration of the boundary event:

<ul>
  <li>Interrupting boundary event: The activity is interrupted and the sequence flow going out of the event is followed.</li>
  <li>Non-interrupting boundary event: One token stays in the activity and an additional token is created which follows the sequence flow going out of the event.</li>
</ul>
