Activiti uses Unified Expression Language (UEL) for expression-resolving. This is part of the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/tutorial/doc/gjddd.html">Java EE 6 specification</a>. To support all features of latest UEL spec on ALL environments, we use a modified version of <a href="http://juel.sourceforge.net/">JUEL</a>.
</p>

Expressions can be used in for example Java Service tasks, Execution Listeners, Task Listeners and Conditional sequence flows. Although there are 2 types of expressions, value-expression and method-expression, the engine abstracts this so they can both be used where an expression is needed.

<ul>
    <li><strong>Value expression:</strong> resolves to a value. By default, all process variables are available to use. Also all spring-beans (if using Spring) or CDI beans (if using CDI) are available to use in expressions. Some examples:
    
<div class="app-source" app-source-no-tabs="juel1"></div>
<script type="text/xml" id="juel1">   
    ${myVar}
    ${myBean.myProperty}
</script>
    </li>

    <li><strong>Method expression:</strong> invokes a method, with or without parameters. When invoking a method without parameters, be sure to add empty parentheses after the method-name (as this distinguishes the expression from a value expression). The passed parameters can be literal values or expressions that are resolved themselves. Examples:
    
<div class="app-source" app-source-no-tabs="juel2"></div>
<script type="text/xml" id="juel2">   
    ${printer.print()}
    ${myBean.addNewOrder('orderName')}
    ${myBean.doSomething(myVar, execution)}
</script>
    </li>
</ul>

Note that these expressions support resolving primitives (incl. comparing them), beans, lists, arrays and maps.
</p>
<p>
On top of all process variables, there are a few default objects available to be used in expressions:
<ul>
    <li><strong>execution:</strong> The DelegateExecution that holds additional information about the ongoing execution.</li>
    <li><strong>task:</strong> The DelegateTask that holds additional information about the current Task. Note: Only works in expressions evaluated from task listeners.</li>
    <li><strong>authenticatedUserId:</strong> The id of the user that is currently authenticated. If no user is authenticated, the variable is not available.</li>
</ul>
