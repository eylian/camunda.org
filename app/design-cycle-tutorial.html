			</div>

				<div class="span10">
					<p>
						With camunda Cycle you can create a roundtrip between a BPMN 2.0 modeler and your Development Repository (SVN, Local File etc.).
					</p>
					<p>
						That way you can use a sophisticated BPMN Design Environment that especially suits your Business Users (Busines Analysts, Subject Matter Experts etc.), while keeping the process models created in those tools in synch with the ones that are executed by the camunda process engine. 
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>

		<section id="simpleSect">
			<div class="page-header" >
				<h1>Setup</h1>
			</div>
			<p>Cycle is already included in the camunda BPM distributions (<a href="">Download Area</a>). 
				Just open <a href="http://localhost:8080/cycle">http://localhost:8080/cycle</a> and create a new Admin User.
			</p>
			<p>
				Since your process models will be stored in certain repositories, you should setup the respective connectors. In the upper right menu, navigate to "Connectors". Hit the "New"-Button, and follow the steps below depending on what kind of connector you want to setup.
			</p>
			<h3>File Connector</h3>
			<div class="row-fluid">
				<div id="cycle-file" class="thumbnail span2" data-img-thumb img-src="./assets/img/cycle/file.png" ></div>
				<div class="span8">
					<p>
						Here is a typical configuration for setting up a connector to your local File System. The variable "${user.home}" in this example points to the directory of your user in your Operating System, so if your user is "horst" and you are a Windows-User, this would mean "C:\Users\horst". You can also choose an absolute path like "C:\MyFolder".
						</p><p> Hit "Test" to check if Cycle can find the folder you specified. 
					</p>
			</div>
			</div>
			<h3>Subversion (SVN) Connector</h3>
			<div class="row-fluid">
				<div id="cycle-svn" class="thumbnail span2" data-img-thumb img-src="./assets/img/cycle/svn.png" ></div>
				<div class="span8">
					<p>
						When connecting to a Subversion repository, you must specifiy the URL (including subfolders, if you want to directly point to a certain folder in the Subversion repository). 
						If user credentials are mandatory, you can provide them either globally, or individually for each Cycle user. In this example, we assume that every Cycle user will use the same credentials when using this connector, which is why we provide them in this dialog. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Hit "Test" to check if Cycle can connect to the SVN repo with the credentials you provided. 
					</p>
				</div>
		</section>		
			<div class="page-header" >
				<h1>Create a Roundtrip</h1>
			</div>
			<div class="row-fluid">
				<div id="cycle-create" class="thumbnail span2" data-img-thumb img-src="./assets/img/cycle/create.png" ></div>
				<div class="span8">
					<p>
						At the left box "My Roundtrips", hit "Create" to create a new Roundtrip. Pick a name and hit "OK". In our example, we assume that a new Roundtrip named "invoice" has been created.
					</p>
					<p>
						We will now add a process model from our BPMN modeler to the roundtrip, and create the process model we want to execute out of it. Below we describe the roundtrip using Signavio, further below you can find a general description for other BPMN tools. 
					</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="page-header" >
				<h1>Roundtrip with Signavio</h1>
			</div>
			<div class="row-fluid">
				<div id="signavio" class="thumbnail span2" data-img-thumb img-src="./assets/img/cycle/signavio.png" ></div>
				<div class="span8">
					<p>
						The guys from <a href="http://www.Signavio.com">Signavio</a> have created a quite cool BPMN modeler - this is probably because they are located in the quite cool city of Berlin, just like us. If you don't know it yet, you should it give it a try. It's completely browser based, extremely intuitive to use (so it's perfect for Business users), and offers several helpful collaboration features.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>Signavio Connector</h3>
			<div class="row-fluid">
				<div id="signavio-connector" class="thumbnail span2" data-img-thumb img-src="./assets/img/cycle/signavio-connector.png" ></div>
				<div class="span8">
					<p>
						For directly accessing your process models stored in Signavio, you must setup a Signavio Connector.
					</p><p>In our example, we use the SaaS edition and provide the credentials globally, meaning that every Cycle user will use the same credentials when using this connector. If you are behind a proxy, you could configure that here as well.
					</p><p> Hit "Test" to check if Cycle can access your Signavio account. 
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>Add process model from Signavio</h3>
			<div class="row-fluid">
				<div id="signavio-choose-model" class="thumbnail span2" data-img-thumb img-src="./assets/img/cycle/signavio-choose-model.png" ></div>
				<div class="span8">
					<p>
						In the left box of your roundtrip, click on "Add process Model", pick a name and choose "Signavio SaaS" from the connectors dropdown. Cycle now connects with Signavio, so after a short time you can navigate through the tree to select your process model.
					</p>
					<p>
						After you hit "Add", Cycle will save a link to the process model you selected, and offers you a preview image in the left box of your roundtrip. It also says that the process model has not yet been synchronized, which is true. 
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>Create BPMN file for execution</h3>
			<div class="row-fluid">
				<div id="cycle-create-executable" class="thumbnail span2" data-img-thumb img-src="./assets/img/cycle/cycle-create-executable.png" ></div>
				<div class="span8">
					<p>
						Hit "Create" and choose the location you want the BPMN 2.0 XML File to be stored to. In our example, we want to store it on our local file system, in a workspace we use with our Eclipse IDE. After hitting "Create", Cycle will connect to Signavio, request the BPMN 2.0 XML and save it to the location you specified.
					</p>
					<div class="alert">
						<b>Heads up!</b> If your process model is a collaboration diagram, Cycle will check which pools are flagged as "executable". Only those pools will actually be regarded for the executable process model, so you don't have to bother with huge diagrams describing manual flows, while you are only interested in the technical flows that shall be executed by the process engine. We call this feature "Pool Extraction".
