Contribution Guidelines
=======================

> This page is still work in Progress.

When you contribute your work on a feature or bug fix consider the following

## Coding styles:

* tabs as spaces / tab size 2 (all files)
* Try to avoid inline css style and javascript if possible
* If you created a number of commits, [squash](http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/10/squashing-commits-with-rebase.html) your work into a few commits only.
* Create commit messages that adhere to [our commit message style](COMMIT_MESSAGES.md). Be verbose, i.e. use the message body to describe what you did and why.
